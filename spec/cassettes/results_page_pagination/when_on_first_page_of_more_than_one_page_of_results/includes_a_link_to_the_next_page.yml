        reports of situations in which children age 17 or under may be in jeopardy
        because of abuse, abandonment, sexual molestation, exploitation or neglect.
        When the home situation is such that the child needs to be placed under the
        protection of the juvenile court, this unit initiates court action, conducts
        an investigation and supervises children who have been removed from parental
        custody. Can make immediate placements in emergency shelter care when children
        are endangered. May also aid children by providing casework and related services
        to their families, and making referrals to appropriate agencies.                  A
        report may be made in person, by phone or letter and may be anonymous, though
        all names are held confidential. Anyone initiating a referral in good faith
        is immune from liability. Provides information and refers within the agency
        for all specialized children''s services. Counseling, support groups and in-home
        services can be provided to families receiving protective services supervision
        from this agency. Provides shelter care for children, age 18 or under, who

        receiving home. All requests for emergency care or removal of a child from
        a home in crisis must be made through the Hotline or the local police department.
