/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will
 * include all the files listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets,
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets
 * directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear
 * at the bottom of the compiled file so the styles you add here take
 * precedence over styles defined in any styles defined in the other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new file per
 * style scope.
