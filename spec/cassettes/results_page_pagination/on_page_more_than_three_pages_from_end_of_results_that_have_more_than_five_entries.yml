        a continuum of transitional residential and vocational day training programs
        for individuals who have developmental disabilities such as mental retardation,
        cerebral palsy, epilepsy or autism. FHAR programs emphasize experiencing the
        daily routine and rhythm of a well-balanced life including social relationships,
        proper diet, exercise, leisure, employment, financial planning and maintenance
        of one''s environment. Acquisition of independent living and life skills is
        a primary goal for all FHAR consumers.         FHAR''s residential continuum
        includes eight licensed adult residential facilities. Reflecting the belief
        that consumers should reside in the least restrictive environment, FHAR''s
        residential services involve gradually decreasing levels of staff support
        while increasing levels of client independence. Independent Living and Supported
        Living Services provides indefinite support services and training to consumers
        living in their own apartment, FHAR''s eight Independent Group Residences
        or FHAR''s Berkshire apartment complex. The Adult Day Program is a pre-vocational
        program for 42 consumers who have behavioral/emotional challenges that prevent
        their successful participation within standard vocational programs. The purpose
        of this program is to prepare the participants with the necessary skills to
        use existing community services and to move from this highly structured community
        day treatment program to a less restrictive one. The Employment Support Services
        program is a community-based day program for 60 consumers. It emphasizes independent
        living skills acquisition, vocational skills acquisition and employment opportunities
        or volunteer experiences with non-disabled peers. Clients are integrated into
        the work force and continuously supported and supervised by FHAR staff to
        ensure successful and long-term placement.","emails":["fhar@fhar.org"],"faxes":[{"number":"650
