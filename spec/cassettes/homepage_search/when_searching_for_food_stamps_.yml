        Not a diet or calorie-counting club. There are no official food plans. Instead,

        of compulsive overeating. Recovery is threefold: physical, emotional and spiritual,
        and is aided by study of the 12 steps. Some meetings have special focuses
        such as anorexics and bulimics, over 100 pound weight loss, gay, young people,
        women, etc., but all meetings are open to everyone. In many cases, a 30-minute
