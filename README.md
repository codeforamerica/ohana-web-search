Ohana Web Search is the web-based search portion of the Ohana project. It requires connecting to your own instance of [Ohana API](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api), which will provide the data to Ohana Web Search.

This project was developed by [Code for America's 2013 San Mateo County, CA,](http://codeforamerica.org/2013-partners/san-mateo-county/) fellowship team. Thanks to a [grant from the Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201447979/), [@monfresh](https://github.com/monfresh), [@spara](https://github.com/spara), and [@anselmbradford](https://github.com/anselmbradford) will continue to push code in 2014.

Ohana Web Search aims to make it easy to find available services in a community, and to provide as much pertinent information as possible, such as travel directions, hours of operation, other services residents in need might be eligible for, etc.
You can see a live example for services in San Mateo County, CA, here: [http://smc-connect.org](http://smc-connect.org)

## Running the tests
To test locally, you can run tests with this simple command:

    script/test

To configure the way RSpec displays test results, create a file called `.rspec` in the root directory, and add the following to it:

    --color
    --format progress

The `--color` option allows you to see passing tests in green and failing ones in red. Otherwise, by default, you would just see a series of dots for passing tests, and the letter "F" for failing ones.

Parameters for the `--format` option are: `progress` (default - shows a series of dots), `documentation`, `html`, or `textmate`. [More information can be found on the RSpec website](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/3-0/docs/configuration/read-command-line-configuration-options-from-files).

To see the actual tests, browse through the [spec](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-web-search/tree/master/spec) directory.
