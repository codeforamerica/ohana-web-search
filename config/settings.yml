# HOMEPAGE LINKS SETTINGS
#
##########################
#
# In the homepage_links section below, you can customize the
# text for the header and links that appear on the bottom half
# of the home page. There are two type of links, "general" and
# "emergency", which correspond to the two "boxes" on the homepage.
#
# To edit the header for each group of links, change the text of
# the keys that are indented below the "general:" or "emergency:" key.
# When we say "key", we refer to any entry in this file that ends with a colon.
# The items under the header key correspond to the text of the links
# under each header.
#
# Clicking a link on the homepage will perform a search for the full
# text of the link, unless the text contains words in parentheses, or
# two words separated by a slash. In those cases, a search will be
# performed for the first word only. For example, clicking on a
# "SNAP (Food Stamps)" or "SNAP/Food Stamps" link will search for "SNAP".
# Keep this in mind when editing or adding link text below.
#
# To add or replace a group of links, indent them below the "general:"
# and/or "emergency:" key. For example, to add a new group of general
# links, you would follow this format:
#
# general:
#   Header Text for New Group:
#     - text for link 1
#     - text for link 2

# INFO BOX SETTINGS
#
####################
#
# In this section, you can define the content for informational boxes that
# will appear at the top of the search results page whenever someone searches
# for a specific keyword or phrase that you define below.
# For example, if someone searches for "food stamps," you might want to display
# information about the federal SNAP program.
#
# To define a new info box, add a new entry indented under "info_box_terms:"
# using this format:
#
# info_box_terms:
#   short_name_for_your_info_box:
#     synonyms:
#       - synonym1
#       - synonym2
#       - synonym3
#     title: title for this info box
#     description:
#       description for this this info box
#     url: website that provides more info
#
# Once you define an info box, all fields are required except for the url.
#
# The name for your info box can be whatever you want. We recommend
# keeping it short and memorable, and making it all lowercase with
# underscores to separate words to keep it more readable.
#
# The synonyms are all the words, phrases, and acronyms that should
# trigger the info box. They must all be lowercase.
#
# The title and description are self-explanatory. On the website,
# the title will appear in bold above the description.
#
# If you provide an url, the "More info..." link in the info box
# will point to it.
#
# To see an info box in action, go to http://ohana-web-search-demo.herokuapp.com
# and search for "wic".
#
# By default, all info boxes use the same HTML template that looks like this:
# <dl>
#   <dt>title_of_info_box</dt>
#   <dd>info_box_description</dd>
#   <p>
#     <a href="info_box_url" target="_blank">More info...</a>
#   </p>
# </dl>
# This HTML is generated by the "render_info_box" method in
# app/helpers/info_box_helper.rb.
#
# If you would like to use a custom template for a particular info box,
# you can create the HTML for it in a partial in the
# "app/views/component/info_box/" directory. The partial must begin with
# an underscore.
# See app/view/component/info_box/_example_custom_template.html.haml for
# and example of a custom template.
#
# Once the template is created, you can assign it to an info box via the
# "custom:" field. An info box that uses a custom template only needs
# the "synonyms:" and "custom:" fields because you would be entering all
# the text directly in the custom template. The value of the "custom:" field
# should be the path to the partial, starting with "component", but without
# the underscore in the partial name. For example, to set up an info box that
# points to "_example_custom_template.html.haml", do this:
#
# info_box_terms:
#   custom_info_box:
#     synonyms:
#       - health care reform
#       - aca
#     custom: component/info_box/example_custom_template
