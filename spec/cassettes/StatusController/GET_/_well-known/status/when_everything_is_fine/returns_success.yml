        do not receive health insurance through their employers and cannot afford
        to pay for “out-of-pocket” health insurance. Often these residents are forced
        to seek treatment at local emergency rooms and become saddled with medical
        bills that they are unable to pay. Samaritan House’s Free Medical Clinics
        fill this gap in healthcare access for the uninsured and save emergency room
        resources for emergencies. Professional Medical \u0026 Dental Volunteers Thanks
        to its innovative volunteer-based model of service, Samaritan House’s clinics
        are able to treat such a large number of patients with a very small paid staff.
        Almost all of the medical and dental doctors and assistants are volunteering
        their time free of charge. These individuals, either retired or currently

        public services to assist clients to find permanent housing and other needed
        services. Referrals are accepted from county mental health agencies, the Probation
        Department and core service centers. A Transitional Housing Program serves
        seven clients in single rooms and 60 additional clients are served in single
        rooms of permanent housing. Friendship Centers throughout San Mateo County

        pay utility bills, WELL Program enrollment fees, temporary co-payments for
        prescribed medication and temporary shelter in a motel. Case managers can
        refer participants for other services including medical care, social work
