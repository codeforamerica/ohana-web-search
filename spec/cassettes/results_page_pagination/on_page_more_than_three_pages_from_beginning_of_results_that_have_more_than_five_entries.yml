        Social Security benefits are based on the worker''s wages and may be paid
        to the worker or the worker''s dependents or survivors. People in need of
        cash aid who are age 65 or over, or who are blind or disabled including blind
        and disabled children, may apply for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSI
        recipients automatically qualify for Medi-Cal. Medicare is the federal health

        have chronic kidney disease. It is best to check first the Web site for information
        about qualifications and the necessary documentation which must be submitted.
        Interim emergency financial assistance may be obtained from the San Mateo
