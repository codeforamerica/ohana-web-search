        a continuum of services for older adults and adults with disabilities. Centralized
        Intake serves as the single point of entry to adult services within Aging
        and Adult Services and provides referrals to community-based social support
        programs.   Adult Protective Services is a function of Centralized Intake.
        The TIES Line, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line, receives reports of suspected
        dependent adult and older adult abuse and neglect. The Centralized Intake
        Unit, which consists of a multi-disciplinary staff of social workers, public
        health nurses and deputy public guardians, conducts comprehensive assessments
        of the client and the allegations, provides information and referral, access
        and advocacy to county-operated and/or community-based programs as part of
        the service plan that is developed. Centralized Intake has a 24-Hour Response
        Program. A social worker receives telephone calls from the community, assesses
        the client-related matter over the telephone, makes a home visit if appropriate,
        and may provide short-term emergency protection such as shelter, food, or
        protective supervision until a long-term plan is developed by an assigned
        case manager. The Centralized Intake''s Representative Payee Program serves
        individuals who are not conserved, but who need assistance in managing their
        public benefits. In-Home Supportive Services provides assistance with personal
        and domestic services for financially-eligible older adults, individuals who
        are blind and disabled, and children who, without these services, would be
        unable to remain safely in their homes. Public Guardianship/Conservatorship,
        appointed by and under the authority and direction of the Superior Court,
        assists frail elderly individuals and persons with substantial physical and/or
        mental disabilities who are unable to provide for their own personal needs,
        manage their financial resources, or resist fraud and undue influence. Multipurpose
        Senior Services Program (MSSP) is a comprehensive case management program
        that serves persons age 65 or over who need nursing home level care and are
        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature
        placement. The AIDS Case Management Program provides comprehensive home and
        community-based services to persons with AIDS or symptomatic HIV. The program
        uses an interdisciplinary core case management team consisting of a nurse
        case manager and a social work case manager working with the client to determine
        needed services. The Area Agency on Aging (650-573-2700) administers funding
        for a variety of programs, advocates on behalf of older persons and provides
        long-range planning, coordination, and program development for programs and
        services for older adults. The New Beginning Coalition (650-573-3527) is a
        broad-based group of providers and consumers that works in partnership with
        Aging and Adult Services and other organizations to improve the quality of
        life of older persons and adults with disabilities. Other programs include
        the Commission on Aging and the Commission on Disabilities (described separately).","emails":["lmancini@smcgov.org"],"faxes":["650
