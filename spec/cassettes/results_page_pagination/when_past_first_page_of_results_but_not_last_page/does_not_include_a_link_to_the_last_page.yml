        and sexuality issues. Prevention and education programs teach adolescents
        about AIDS. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Shelter offers short-term housing
        for runaway and homeless youth, minor delinquents or substance abusers, and
        other troubled youth who could benefit from short-term separation from parents
        while they work out their problems. Individual, group and family counseling
        is provided to assist with family reunification and to change inappropriate
        and destructive behavior of youth. Quetzal House, a residential program for
        adolescent girls, in partnership with the Children''s Shelter of Santa Clara
        County, provides specific services to adolescent girls who are dependents
        of the court and who exhibit chronic runaway behavior. The purpose of this
        partnership is to change destructive behaviors in order to enable participants
        to successfully re-enter the county foster care system. Homeless youth services
        include street outreach counseling, drug abuse counseling, assistance with
        long-term housing, job placement, educational services and family reunification.
        The goal of the services is to renew family ties when possible and to stabilize
        the lives of homeless youth to avoid victimization from street life and involvement
        in criminal activities. Drop-in center located at 693 South 2nd Street, San
        Jose. Independent living skills training is provided to older adolescents
        in foster care and to homeless youth needing additional skills to become productive,
        independent adults. Groups focus on teaching skills to youth such as locating
        employment and permanent housing, developing personal budgets and using community
        resources. The Transitional Housing Program for Homeless Youth provides comprehensive
        services for older youth (age 16-22) as well as homeless young parents and
        their infants. The program offers long-term shelter (up to 18 months) in subsidized
        shared housing and apartments while youth learn the skills necessary to live
        on their own. Teen parents are taught parenting skills in addition to living
        skills so that they can support themselves and their children and avoid becoming
        dependent on welfare. Program staff continue to provide follow-up care after
        youth leave the program to help youth make the successful transition to self-sufficiency.
        Project Safe Place in San Jose provides children age 8-17 with a safe place
        to go for help. Businesses, schools and community centers display the Safe

        services system. These children have been removed from their birth families
        because of child abuse or severe neglect and are impacted by trauma, grief
        and loss. The primary goal is to prepare the child for permanency, which means
        either their return to appropriate, stable birth family members, placement
        into an adoptive famly, or adoption by the foster family. Adoption program
        prepares families to parent children with special needs from the child welfare
        system. The program''s goal is permanency for the child. The placement coordinator
        works closely with county social workers and approved families to ensure the
        child''s needs will be met by a famly that is willing and capable of parenting
        the child. Services provided include in-depth home studies, and assist the
        child and family to form a lasting connection. Additionally, private home
        study services are available to the community for private adoptions on a fee
