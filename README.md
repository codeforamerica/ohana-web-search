[SMC-Connect](http://www.smc-connect.org) is a Ruby on Rails app that makes it easy to find human services, farmers' markets, and other community organizations in San Mateo County, California.

The app is powered by the [Ohana API](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api) platform which was developed by [Code for America's 2013 San Mateo County, CA,](http://codeforamerica.org/2013-partners/san-mateo-county/) fellowship team: [@monfresh](https://github.com/monfresh), [@spara](https://github.com/spara), and [@anselmbradford](https://github.com/anselmbradford).

In San Mateo County, there are two apps powered by Ohana: [SMC-Connect](http://smc-connect.org) and the [San Mateo County API](https://github.com/smcgov/ohana-api-smc) (that feeds the data to SMC-Connect). The API also comes with a built-in admin interface that allows organization members to update their own data. The updates are reflected in real-time on SMC-Connect.

## Running the tests
To test locally, you can run tests with this simple command:

    script/test

To configure the way RSpec displays test results, create a file called `.rspec` in the root directory, and add the following to it:

    --color
    --format progress

The `--color` option allows you to see passing tests in green and failing ones in red.

Parameters for the `--format` option are: `progress` (default - shows a series of dots), `documentation`, `html`, or `textmate`. [More information can be found on the RSpec website](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/3-0/docs/configuration/read-command-line-configuration-options-from-files).

To see the actual tests, browse through the [spec](https://github.com/smcgov/SMC-Connect/tree/master/spec) directory.
