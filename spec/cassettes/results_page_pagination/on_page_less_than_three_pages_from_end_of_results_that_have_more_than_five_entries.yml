        Mentoring Services program matches at-risk youth ages 8-17 with adult volunteers
        recruited from the community for the purpose of forming one-to-one relationships.
        Each adult mentor makes a one-year commitment to spend a minimum of three
        hours per week with the youth. In preparation for the matching, adults attend
        an information session and mentor training concentrating on an overview of
        the program and working with youth. Adult volunteers also receive support
        through weekly contacts with a trained program coordinator. Life skills training
        and support groups are also available.  Children voluntarily enter the program
        and may be referred by the Probation Department, social workers, schools or
        other youth professionals. Comprehensive year-round activities for Junior
        and Senior Friends include recreational, educational, community service and
        cultural experiences at little or no cost. Volunteers are informed of special
        program news and events through a monthly newsletter and an annual report
        is distributed to interested community members. The Mentoring Institute provides
        mentoring technical assistance to other agencies.","emails":["rebecca@friendsforyouth.org"],"faxes":[{"number":"650
