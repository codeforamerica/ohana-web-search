        The department establishes paternity, medical support orders, child support

        support and/or medical support order, or want to establish one, can apply
        for services. Parents who receive public assistance, including Medi-Cal, will
        automatically be referred to the San Mateo County Department of Child Support
        Services (SMC/DCSS) by the County of San Mateo Human Services Agency. If paternity
        (fatherhood) has not yet been established, the SMC/DCSS will take the necessary
        steps to establish paternity. (Paternity must be established before child
        and medical support can be ordered by the court.) If a court order for child
        support does not already exist, and the noncustodial parent is located, one
        will be sought by the SMC/DCSS and established by the court based on both
        parents'' ability to pay support, the amount of time the child spends with
        each parent, and the financial needs of the child. The SMC/DCSS will also
        request that the court require the noncustodial parent to provide health insurance
        if it is available at a reasonable cost. The SMC/DCSS will take steps to enforce
        court orders for child support and medical support. Enforcement action will
        be taken by the SMC/DCSS if the noncustodial parent does not pay or pays less
        than the amount ordered, or if the noncustodial parent does not provide health
        insurance for the child as ordered by the court. The SMC/DCSS will determine

        Victim Advocates provide crisis intervention, emergency assistance, and/or
        resource and referral assistance. The advocates assist victims with the process
        of filing a claim for state compensation through the California Victim Compensation
        Program (CalVCP) for medical, mental health or burial expenses, resulting
        from a violent crime that is not covered by any other source of reimbursement,
        such as medical, vehicle or homeowners insurance. If applicable and eligible,
        a victim and/or family members of the victim can also file a CalVCP claim
        for compensation for income or support loss. CalVCP does not compensate monetary,
        or property loss or damage, or pain and suffering. The main Victim Services
        office is located in the Hall of Justice, 400 County Center, DA’s Office,
        3rd Floor in Redwood City. There is also a satellite office located in the
        Northern Court Building, 1050 Mission Road, DA’s Office in South San Francisco.","kind":"Human

        on their own. Some of those tasks may be very important for health and safety
        reasons. That’s when in-home caregivers can make the difference between the
        person’s being able to continuing to live at home instead of having to move
        to an assisted living facility or nursing home. Geriatric Care Managers: Geriatric
        Care Management is a discipline that includes: - Assessing the care needs
        of the client. - Planning for the provision of services that address those
        care needs. - Supervising the delivery of those service and assessing their
        effectiveness. Families with the wisdom and foresight to seek the assistance
